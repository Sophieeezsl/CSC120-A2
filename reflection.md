Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I would suggest future students to spend more time on planning, from method design to syntax choosing, before actually programming. 

(make up reflection because I didn't write it the first time)
I think this task did introduce me to OOP by letting me change the same function in the procedural to object oriented way. 
It also helped me review python programming.
Some mistakes are fixed using feedback as reference.
